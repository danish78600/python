# python is a programming language whihc is very simple and easy to use. 

# we can insatll any module with the use of pip . by using this pip we can install any module 

# 2 type of modules:-
# built in-already present when you download python
# external-we have to download by using pip

# pip is a package manager.

# print is a function in python which is used to print something.

# we can also execute python code by writing python filename in terminal of vs code

# the line of code which we dont want to execute so we can comment it .

# types of comments-
# single line- denoted by #
# multi line comment- '''comment here'''

# escape sequence character - to insert character that cannot be used as string we use escape sequence character.

# for e.g. \n 

# we can add multiple values inside print statement and that multiple values we can seperate by using sep="=" with the values in print statement.
# end is also a parameter end="" which tell that when this line is executed then which thing to print

# variables are containers that holds data creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory 

# a string data type is denoted by "" double quotes. 

# data type specifies type of value a variable can holds. this is reqired to perform operations without causing error.

# python has built in data types such as int string boolean etc.

# boolean has only 2 values true or false.

# list is a collection of items that are of different data types. they are immutable means that they cannot be changed.

# dictionary is a collection of key value pairs.

# in python all is object such as int char string etc. boolean are object

# Type casting is the process of conversion of one data type to other data type

# for e.g. we can typecast a="9" to integer by int(a) but the value inside a must be valid for the provided data type

# types of typecasting:
# implicit-when python itself does the conversion
# explicit-when the programmer itself do the conversion.

# In Python, when the data type conversion takes place during compilation or during the runtime,

# for e.g. if there are  2 variables one is of int data type other is of float and if we add these 2 then the result will be in float

# we can also give inputs to our python program by input function that takes a string . and if we needs int as an input then we can use int before input function such as int(input())

# whenever we enclosed something in double or single quotes then it is considered string.

# to print a multiline string we can use ''' triple double or single quotes.
