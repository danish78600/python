# in this we are importing danish and it has name method and we have caled it in danish so if we 
# only import danish in this class then all the called methods of danish will be automatically called 
# so to solve this problem we have used main functiom

#Main function is like the entry point of a program. However, Python interpreter runs the code right from the first line. 


import danish


danish.name()

# the exaple of main method is in danish.py
# __name__ this means that from where it is printed
